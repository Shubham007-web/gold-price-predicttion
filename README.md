# Gold Price Predicttion

This dataset file is a Comma separated value (csv) file format with 2290 rows and 7 columns. It contains 5 columns which are numerical in datatype and one column in Date format. Clearly the data shows value of the variables SPX,GLD,USO,SLV,EUR/USD against the dates in the date column.
- Based on the above dataset, This is regression problem so, I made machine learning model for regression task to predict gold price.
- In this model I have used RandomForestRegressor for making prediction.
- I saved model weights with **.dat (binary file)** extension to make new prediction without training dataset again and again.
